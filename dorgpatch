/**
 * @file
 * Drush shell script for creating a patch for your Drupal module.
 * Requires the following setup:
 *
 *  - You are on a git feature branch for your issue.
 *  - The branch name is of the format '1234-description-of-issue' where 1234
 *    is the drupal.org issue number.
 *  - The feature branch is rebased to the major development branch you want to
 *    diff against.
 *  - All your work is committed.
 *
 * Optional, to support a 'tests-only' patch:
 *  - Your changes to tests are all on a branch whose name is of the format
 *    '1234-tests'. This should be merged into your feature branch.
 *
 * Pass a parameter to give a comment number for the issue. Alternatively, the
 * script can query drupal.org's API to get the number for the next comment on
 * the issue.
